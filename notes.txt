next steps
1. divise a series of increasingly difficult algebra problems that could reasoably be solved with this model
    -i.e add more terms, switch up coefficients and varaibles, not solfing using quadratic formula, etc

2. come up with basic geometry test. what can be solved already? what additional training is needed?

-is it possible for the model to "jump" to pass geometry test with minimal training?

-will definetley need to be trained on sin.cos.tan

3. advanced algebra - how to solve using quadratic formula (or more general case, solve system of equations)

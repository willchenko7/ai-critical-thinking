Introduction
Foryears, doctors and engineers have work edtomak eartificial limbs, such asthis hand forpeople who need them. This
particular product isdiffer ent, however, because itwas developed using a3Dprinter. Asaresult, itcan beprinted much
likeyou print wordsonasheet ofpaper. This mak esproducing thelimb less expensive and faster than conventional
methods.
Biomedical engineers areworking todevelop organs that may one daysave lives. Scientists atNASA aredesigning ways to
use3Dprinters tobuild onthemoon orMars. Already, animals arebenefitting from3D-printed parts, including atortoise
shell and a dog leg. Builders have e ven constructed entir e buildings using a 3D printer.
The technology and use of3Dprinters depend ontheability tounderstand thelanguage ofalgebr a.Engineers must

Multiple of a Number
A number is a multiple ofnif it is the pr oduct of a counting number and n.
Another way tosaythat 15isamultiple of3istosaythat 15isdivisible by3.That means that when wedivide 3into 15,
we get a counting number. In fact, 15÷3is 5, so 15 is 5·3.
Divisible by a Number
If a number mis a multiple of n, then misdivisible byn.

Divisibility Tests
A number is divisible b y:
2 if the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
3 if the sum of the digits is divisible b y3.
5 if the last digit is 5 or 0.
6 if it is divisible b y both 2 and 3.
10 if it ends with 0.6 Chapter 1 Foundations

Is 5,625 divisible b yⓐ2?ⓑ3?ⓒ5 or 10? ⓓ6?
Solution
ⓐ
Is 5,625 divisible b y 2?
Does it end in 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8?No.
5,625 is not divisible b y 2.
ⓑ
Is 5,625 divisible b y 3?
What is the sum of the digits? 5+6+2+5=18
Is the sum divisible b y 3?Yes.
5,625 is divisible b y 3.
ⓒ
Is 5,625 divisible b y 5 or 10?
What is the last digit? It is 5. 5,625 is divisible b y 5 but not b y 10.
ⓓ
Is 5,625 divisible b y 6?
Is it divisible b y both 2 and 3? No, 5,625 is not divisible b y 2, so 5,625 is not divisible b y 6.

Inmathematics, ther eareoften severalways totalk about thesame ideas. Sofar,we’ve seen that ifmisamultiple ofn,
wecansaythat misdivisible byn.Forexample, since 72isamultiple of8,wesay72isdivisible by8.Since 72isamultiple
of 9, we say 72 is divisible b y 9. W e can e xpress this still another way.
Since 8·9=72,we say that 8 and 9 ar efactors of 72. When we write 72=8·9,we say we have factor ed 72.
Other ways tofactor 72are1·72,2·36,3·24,4·18,and 6·12.The number 72has many factors:
1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,and 72.
Factors
Ifa·b=m,then aand barefactors ofm.
Some numbers, such as72,have many factors. Other numbers have only two factors. Aprime number isacounting
number gr eater than 1 whose only factors ar e 1 and itself.Chapter 1 Foundations 7Prime number and Composite number
Aprime number is a counting number gr eater than 1 whose only factors ar e 1 and the number itself.
Acomposite number isacounting number greater than 1that isnotprime. Acomposite number has factors other
than 1 and the number itself.
The counting numbers from2to20arelisted inthetable with their factors. Mak esuretoagreewith the“prime” or
“composite” label for each!
The prime numbers less than 20 ar e 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. Notice that the only e ven prime number is 2.
Acomposite number canbewritten asaunique product ofprimes. This iscalled theprime factorization ofthenumber.
Finding the prime factorization of a composite number will be useful in many topics in this course.
Prime Factorization
The prime factorization of a number is the pr oduct of prime numbers that equals the number.
Tofind theprime factorization ofacomposite number, find any two factors ofthenumber and use them tocreate two
branches. Ifafactor isprime, that branch iscomplete. Circlethat prime. Otherwise itiseasy tolose trackoftheprime
numbers.
Ifthefactor isnotprime, find two factors ofthenumber and continue theprocess. Once allthebranches have circled
primes atthe end, the factorization iscomplete. The composite number can nowbewritten asaproduct ofprime
numbers.

will be useful when we add and subtr act fr actions with differ ent denominators.
Least Common Multiple
The least common multiple (L CM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.
Tofind theleast common multiple oftwo numbers wewillusethePrime Factors Method. Let’s find theLCMof12and 18
using their prime factors.
EXAMPLE 1.3 HOW TO FIND THE LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE USING THE PRIME FACTORS METHOD
Find the least common multiple (L CM) of 12 and 18 using the prime factors method.HOW TO : : FIND THE PRIME FACTORIZATION OF A COMPOSITE NUMBER.
Find two factors whose product isthegiven number, and use these numbers tocreate two
branches.
If a factor is prime, that br anch is complete. Cir cle the prime, lik e a leaf on the tr ee.
If a factor is not prime, write it as the pr oduct of two factors and continue the pr ocess.
Write the composite number as the pr oduct of all the cir cled primes.

Step 2.
Step 3.
Step 4.Chapter 1 Foundations 9Solution
Notice that theprime factors of12(2·2·3)and theprime factors of18(2·3·3)areincluded intheLCM (2·2·3·3).
So 36 is the least common multiple of 12 and 18.
Bymatching upthecommon primes, each common prime factor isused only once. This way you aresurethat 36isthe

By not using an equal sign when you simplify an e xpression, you may avoid confusing e xpressions with equations.
Simplify an Expression
Tosimplify an e xpression , do all oper ations in the e xpression.
We’ve introduced most ofthesymbols and notation used inalgebr a,butnowweneed toclarify theorderofoper ations .
Otherwise, e xpressions may have differ ent meanings, and the y may r esult in differ ent values.
For example, consider the expression 4+3·7.Some students simplify this getting 49,byadding 4+3and then
multiplying that r esult b y 7. Others get 25, b y multiplying 3·7first and then adding 4.
The same expression should give thesame result. Somathematicians established some guidelines that arecalled the
order of oper ations.Chapter 1 Foundations 13Students often ask, “HowwillIremember theorder?” Hereisaway tohelp you remember: Takethefirst letter ofeach
key wor d and substitute the silly phr ase “Please Ex cuse My Dear Aunt Sally”.
Parentheses Please

It’sgood that “MyDear” goes together, asthis reminds usthat multiplication and division have equal priority. Wedonot

Identify and Combine Lik e Terms
Algebr aicexpressions aremade upofterms. Aterm isaconstant, ortheproduct ofaconstant and one ormor evariables.
Term
Aterm is a constant or the pr oduct of a constant and one or mor e variables.
Examples of terms ar e7,y,5x2,9a,and b5.
The constant that multiplies the variable is called the coefficient .
Coefficient
The coefficient of a term is the constant that multiplies the variable in a term.
Think ofthecoefficient asthenumber infrontofthevariable. The coefficient oftheterm 3xis3.When wewrite x,the
coefficient is 1, since x=1·x.

Simplify Expr essions with Absolute V alue
Anegative number isanumber less than 0.The negative numbers aretotheleftofzeroonthenumber line. SeeFigur e
1.2.
Figur e 1.2 The number line sho ws the location of
positive and negative numbers.
Youmay have noticed that, onthenumber line, thenegative numbers areamirr orimage ofthepositive numbers, with
zerointhemiddle. Because thenumbers 2and −2arethesame distance fromzero,each one iscalled theopposite of
the other. The opposite of 2is−2,and the opposite of −2is2.
Opposite
The opposite ofanumber isthenumber that isthesame distance fromzeroonthenumber line butontheopposite
side of zer o.
Figur e 1.3 illustr ates the definition.
Figur e 1.3 The opposite of 3 is −3.
Opposite Notation
−ameans t he opposite of t he number a
The no tation −ais read as “t he opposite of a.”
Wesaw that numbers such as3and −3 areopposites because theyarethesame distance from0onthenumber line.
Theyareboth threeunits from0.The distance between 0and anynumber onthenumber lineiscalled theabsolute value
of that number.24 Chapter 1 Foundations
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col31234/1.3Absolute Value
The absolute value of a number is its distance fr om 0 on the number line.
The absolute value of a number nis written as |n|and |n|≥0for all numbers.
Absolute values ar e always gr eater than or equal to zer o.
For e xample,
−5is 5 units a way from 0, so |−5|=5.
5 is 5 units a way from 0, so |5|=5.
Figur e 1.4 illustr ates this idea.
Figur e 1.4 The numbers 5 and −5 are 5 units
away fr om 0.
The absolute value ofanumber isnevernegative because distance cannot benegative. The only number with absolute
value equal to zer o is the number zer o itself because the distance fr om 0 to 0 on the number line is zer o units.
In the ne xt example, we’ll or der e xpressions with absolute values.

Most students arecomfortable with the addition and subtr action facts forpositive numbers. But doing addition or
subtr action with both positive and negative numbers may be mor e challenging.
Wewilluse two color counters tomodel addition and subtr action ofnegatives sothat you can visualize theprocedur es
instead of memorizing the rules.
We let one color (blue) r epresent positive. The other color (r ed) will r epresent the negatives.
Ifwehave one positive counter and one negative counter, thevalue ofthepair iszero.Theyform aneutr alpair. The value
of this neutr al pair is zer o.
We will use the counters to sho w ho w to add:
5+3 −5+(−3) −5+3 5+(−3)
The first e xample, 5+3,adds 5 positives and 3 positives—both positives.Chapter 1 Foundations 27The second e xample, −5+(−3),adds 5 negatives and 3 negatives—both negatives.
When thesigns arethesame, thecounters areallthesame color, and soweadd them. Ineach case weget8—either 8
positives or 8 negatives.
So what happens when the signs ar e differ ent? Let’s add −5+3and 5+(−3).
When weuse counters tomodel addition ofpositive and negative integers, itiseasy tosee whether ther earemor e
positive or mor e negative counters. So we kno w whether the sum will be positive or negative.
EXAMPLE 1.14
Add: ⓐ−1+(−4)ⓑ−1+5ⓒ1+(−5).
Solution
ⓐ
1 negative plus 4 negatives is 5 negatives
ⓑ
Ther e are mor e positives, so the sum is positive.

TRY IT : : 1.27Add: ⓐ−2+(−4)ⓑ−2+4ⓒ2+(−4).
TRY IT : : 1.28Add: ⓐ−2+(−5)ⓑ−2+5ⓒ2+(−5).
Wewillcontinue tousecounters tomodel thesubtr action. Perhaps when you wereyounger, you read “5−3”as“5take
away 3.” When you use counters, you can think of subtr action the same way!
We will use the counters to sho w to subtr act:
5−3 −5−(−3) −5−3 5−(−3)
The first e xample, 5−3,we subtr act 3 positives fr om 5 positives and end up with 2 positives.
In the second e xample, −5−(−3),we subtr act 3 negatives fr om 5 negatives and end up with 2 negatives.
Each e xample used counters of only one color, and the “tak e away” model of subtr action was easy to apply.
What happens when wehave tosubtr actone positive and one negative number? We’llneed touse both blue and red
counters aswell assome neutr alpairs. Ifwedon’t have thenumber ofcounters needed totakeaway, weadd neutr al
pairs. Adding aneutr alpair does notchange thevalue. Itislikechanging quarters tonickels—the value isthesame, but

After wefind theleast common denominator oftwo fractions, weconvert thefractions toequivalent fractions with the
LCD. Putting these steps together allo ws us to add and subtr act fr actions because their denominators will be the same!

Notice (−10 )2=100 also, so−10 isalso asquar erootof100. Ther efore,both 10and −10 aresquar eroots of100. So,
every positive number has two squar eroots—one positive and one negative. The radical sign, m,denotes thepositive
squar eroot. The positive squar erootiscalled theprincipal squar eroot.When weusetheradical sign that always means
we want the principal squar e root.

Ifm=n2,then m=n,forn≥0.
The squar e root of m,m,is the positive number whose squar e ism.

Identify Integers, Rational Numbers, Irr ational Numbers, and Real Numbers
Wehave already described numbers ascounting number s,whole number s,and integers .What isthediffer ence between
these types ofnumbers? Differ ence could beconfused with subtr action. Howabout asking howwedistinguish between
these types of numbers?
Counting numbers 1,2,3,4,…..
Whole numbers 0,1,2,3,4,….
Integ ers ….−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,….
What type ofnumbers would wegetifwestarted with alltheintegers and then included allthefractions? The numbers
wewould have form thesetofrational numbers. Arational number isanumber that can bewritten asaratio oftwo
integers.
Ingener al,any decimal that ends after anumber ofdigits (such as7.3or−1.2684 )isarational number. Wecan use
therecipr ocal (ormultiplicative inverse) oftheplace value ofthelast digit asthedenominator when writing thedecimal

3isthenumber 0.3–
.The baroverthe3indicates that thenumber 3repeats infinitely.
Continuously has animportant meaning incalculus. The number(s) under thebar iscalled therepeating block and it
repeats continuously.
Since allintegers can bewritten asafraction whose denominator is1,theintegers (and soalso thecounting and whole
numbers. ar e rational numbers.
Every rational number canbewritten both asaratio ofintegersp
q,wher epand qareintegers and q≠0,and asadecimal
that stops or r epeats.
Rational Number
Arational number is a number of the formp
q,wher epand qare integers and q≠0.
Its decimal form stops or r epeats.
Arether eany decimals that donotstop orrepeat? Yes!The number π(the Greek letter pi,pronounced “pie”), which is
very important indescribing circles, has adecimal form that does notstop orrepeat. Weuse threedots (…)toindicate
the decimal does not stop or r epeat.
π=3.141592654 ...
The squar e root of a number that is not a perfect squar e is a decimal that does not stop or r epeat.
Anumbers whose decimal form does not stop orrepeat cannot bewritten asafraction ofintegers. Wecall this an
irrational number .Chapter 1 Foundations 67Irrational Number
Anirrational number is a number that cannot be written as the r atio of two integers.
Its decimal form does not stop and does not r epeat.
Let’s summarize a method we can use to determine whether a number is r ational or irr ational.
Rational or Irrational
If the decimal form of a number
•repeats or stops , the number is a rational number .
•does not r epeat and does not stop , the number is an irrational number.
Wehave seen that allcounting numbers arewhole numbers, allwhole numbers areintegers, and allintegers arerational
numbers. The irrational numbers arenumbers whose decimal form does not stop and does not repeat. When weput
together the r ational numbers and the irr ational numbers, we get the set of real number s.
Real Number
Areal number is a number that is either r ational or irr ational.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Use the commutative and associative pr operties
Use the pr operties of identity, inverse, and zer o
Simplify e xpressions using the Distributive Pr operty
BE PREP ARED : : 1.5
Amor ethor ough introduction tothetopics coveredinthis section can befound intheElementary Algebra 2e
chapter, Foundations.
Use the Commutative and Associative Pr operties
The orderweadd two numbers doesn’t affect theresult. Ifweadd 8+9or9+8,theresults arethesame—the yboth
equal 17. So, 8+9=9+8.The or der in which we add does not matter!
Similarly, when multiplying two numbers, theorderdoes notaffect theresult. Ifwemultiply 9·8or8·9theresults are
the same—the y both equal 72. So, 9·8=8·9.The or der in which we multiply does not matter!
These e xamples illustr ate the Commutative Pr operty .
Commutative Property
of Addition Ifaand bare real numbers, t hen a+b=b+a.
of Multiplication Ifaand bare real numbers, t hen a·b=b·a.
When adding or multiplying, changing the ordergives the same r esult.
The Commutative Property has todowith order. Wesubtr act 9−8and 8−9,and see that 9−8≠8−9.Since
changing the or der of the subtr action does not give the same r esult, we kno w that subtraction is not commutative .
Division isnotcommutative either .Since 12÷3≠3÷12,changing theorderofthedivision didnotgive thesame result.
The commutative pr operties apply only to addition and multiplication!
Addition and multiplication arecommutative.
Subtr action and division ar enotcommutative.
When adding threenumbers, changing the grouping ofthe numbers gives the same result. For example,
(7+8)+2=7+(8+2),since each side of the equation equals 17.
This is true for multiplication, too. For e xample,⎛
⎝5·1
3⎞
⎠·3=5·⎛
⎝1
3·3⎞
⎠,since each side of the equation equals 5.
These e xamples illustr ate the Associative Pr operty .
Associative Property
of Addition Ifa,b,and care real numbers, t hen (a+b)+c=a+(b+c).
of Multiplication Ifa,b,and care real numbers, t hen (a·b)·c=a·(b·c).
When adding or multiplying, changing the grouping gives the same r esult.
The Associative Property hastodowith grouping. Ifwechange howthenumbers aregrouped, theresult willbethesame.
Notice it is the same thr ee numbers in the same or der—the only differ ence is the gr ouping.
We saw that subtr action and division wer e not commutative. The y are not associative either.74 Chapter 1 Foundations

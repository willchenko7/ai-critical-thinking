About Intermediate Algebr a 2e
Intermediate Algebra 2eisdesigned tomeet the scope and sequence requir ements ofaone-semester Intermediate
Algebr acourse. The book’s organization mak esiteasy toadapt toavariety ofcourse syllabi. The textexpands onthe
fundamental concepts ofalgebr awhile addr essing theneeds ofstudents with diverse backgr ounds and learning styles.
Each topic builds upon pr eviously de veloped material to demonstr ate the cohesiveness and structur e of mathematics.
Coverage and Scope
Intermediate Algebra 2econtinues thephilosophies and pedagogical featur esofPrealgebra and Elementary Algebra ,by
Lynn Marecek and MaryAnne Anthony-Smith. Byintroducing theconcepts and vocabulary ofalgebr ainanurturing, non-
threatening envir onment while also addr essing theneeds ofstudents with diverse backgr ounds and learning styles, the
book helps students gain confidence in their ability to succeed in the course and become successful college students.
The material ispresented asasequence ofsmall, and clear steps toconceptual understanding. The orderoftopics was
carefully planned toemphasize thelogical progression throughout thecourse and tofacilitate athor ough understanding
of each concept. As ne w ideas ar e presented, the y are explicitly r elated to pr evious topics.
Chapter 1: Foundations
Chapter 1reviewsarithmetic oper ations with whole numbers, integers, fractions, decimals and realnumbers, to
give the student a solid base that will support their study of algebr a.
Chapter 2: Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities
InChapter 2,students learn tosolve linear equations using theProperties ofEquality and agener alstrategy.
Theyuseaproblem-solving strategy tosolve number, percent, mixtur eand uniform motion applications. SolvingPreface 1a formula for a specific variable, and also solving both linear and compound inequalities is pr esented.
Chapter 3: Gr aphs and Functions
Chapter 3covers therectangular coor dinate system wher estudents learn toplot graph linear equations intwo
variables, graph with inter cepts, understand slope ofaline, usetheslope-inter cept form ofanequation ofaline,
find theequation ofaline, and create graphs oflinear inequalities. The chapter also introduces relations and
functions as well as gr aphing of functions.
Chapter 4: Systems of Linear Equations
Chapter 4covers solving systems ofequations bygraphing, substitution, and elimination; solving applications
with systems ofequations, solving mixtur eapplications with systems ofequations, and graphing systems oflinear
inequalities. Systems of equations ar e also solved using matrices and determinants.
Chapter 5: Polynomials and Polynomial Functions
InChapter 5,students learn howtoadd and subtr actpolynomials, use multiplication properties ofexponents,
multiply polynomials, usespecial products, divide monomials and polynomials, and understand integer exponents
and scientific notation.
Chapter 6: Factoring
InChapter 6,students learn theprocess offactoring expressions and seehowfactoring isused tosolve quadr atic
equations.
Chapter 7: Rational Expr essions and Functions
InChapter 7,students work with rational expressions, solve rational equations and usethem tosolve problems in
a variety of applications, and solve r ational inequalities.
Chapter 8: Roots and Radical
InChapter 8,students simplify radical expressions, rational exponents, perform oper ations onradical expressions,
and solve r adical equations. Radical functions and the comple x number system ar e intr oduced
Chapter 9: Quadr atic Equations
InChapter 9,students use various methods tosolve quadr atic equations and equations inquadr atic form and
learn howtouse them inapplications. Students will graph quadr atic functions using their properties and by
transformations.
Chapter 10: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
InChapter 10,students find composite and inverse functions, evaluate, graph, and solve both exponential and
logarithmic functions.
Chapter 11: Conics
InChapter 11,theproperties and graphs ofcircles, parabolas, ellipses and hyperbolas arepresented. Students
also solve applications using the conics and solve systems of nonlinear equations.
Chapter 12: Sequences, Series and the Binomial Theor em
InChapter 12,students areintroduced tosequences, arithmetic sequences, geometric sequences and series and
the binomial theor em.
All chapters ar e broken do wn into multiple sections, the titles of which can be vie wed in the Table of Contents .
Changes to the Second Edition
The Intermediate Algebra 2erevision focused onmathematical clarity and accur acy. Every Example, Try-It, Section Exercise,
ReviewExercise, and Practice Testitem was reviewed bymultiple faculty experts, and then verified byauthors. This
intensive effort resulted inhundr eds ofchanges tothe text,problem language, answers, instructor solutions, and
graphics.
However, OpenStax and ourauthors areawar eofthedifficulties posed byshifting problem and exercise numbers when
textbooks arerevised. Inaneffort tomak ethetransition tothe2nd edition asseamless aspossible, wehave minimized
any shifting ofexercise numbers. Forexample, instead ofdeleting oradding problems wher enecessary, wereplaced
problems inordertokeep thenumbering intact. Asaresult, innearly allchapters, ther ewillbenoshifting ofexercise
numbers; inthechapters wher eshifting does occur, itwillbeminor. Faculty and course coor dinators should beable to
use the ne w edition in a str aightforwar d manner.
Also, toincrease convenience, answers totheBePrepar edExercises willnowappear intheregular solutions manuals,
rather than as a separ ate r esour ce.
A detailed tr ansition guide is available as an instructor r esour ce at openstax.or g.
Pedagogical Foundation and Featur es
Examples Each learning objective issupported byone ormor ework edexamples, which demonstr atetheproblem-solving
appr oaches that students must master. Typically, weinclude multiple examples foreach learning objective tomodel
differ ent appr oaches to the same type of pr oblem, or to intr oduce similar pr oblems of incr easing comple xity.
Allexamples follo wasimple two- orthree-part format. First, wepose aproblem orquestion. Next,wedemonstr atethe
solution, spelling outthesteps along theway. Finally (for select examples), weshowstudents howtocheck thesolution.
Most examples arewritten inatwo-column format, with explanation ontheleftand math ontheright tomimic theway
that instructors “talk thr ough” e xamples as the y write on the boar d in class.2 Preface
